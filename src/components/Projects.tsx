This was my first real hackathon experience and it was fantastic to work in a productive team across the hacking time. We used Next.js for the front end (a new experience for all of us), and Google's Firebase for user authentication.",

This project was a part of my journey to learn functional programming - at this point I was covering observable streams, the crux of this project. The challenging part of this project was definitely the use of these observables, and is the reason I'm proud to call this my first \"real\" project.",

      "This project marked the start of my web development journey - and although elementary, it is a token which represents the start of my career. This was built as a part of my progression through The Odin Project, where I learned the absolute fundamentals of web development. I experimented with my new skills by spending hours creating a simple rock paper scissors game with animations, and this was my final product. Enjoy :)",
