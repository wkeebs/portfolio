    description: "As a quick brain exercise (and to brush up on my Python), I decided to create a static site generator. The generator converts markdown files to HTML, maintaining directory structure for simple document linking to preserve article structure.

    description:
      "As one of my final events as Events Director of Monash Association of Coding (MAC), myself and a few of my colleagues organised one of the most ambitious events our club has done to date. We all had a passion for building custom keyboards, and decided to collaborate with the electrical engineering society to teach our members how to solder, by creating their own custom 16-key macropad. We liased with a local supplier to create custom MAC-themed PCBs, and sourced all of the parts for our members. We taught them how to solder and program the boards, giving them a keypad they can use for macros, or just as a number pad. This was the event that I was most proud of, and characterises what MAC is all about!",

I experimented with my new skills by spending hours creating a simple rock paper scissors game with animations, and this was my final product.",
